# NDTysonCoinFlipSimulation

This is a small program to simulate a thought experiment presented by Neil Degrasse Tyson. N number of participants are to flip a coin, if a person gets tails they exit the game,
if a person gets heads they stay alive and flip again. This is repeated until there's one person left standing. 

*Some limitations - In the experiment it is assumed that the N number of particpants flip a coin simultaneously. In the code I wrote this isn't the case. N participants are 
created and then iterated through one by one for a coin flip and then results are logged after each round. 

I don't have the knowledge on multi-threading or other know how to simulate multiple instances flipping the coin. 

Open to suggestions
